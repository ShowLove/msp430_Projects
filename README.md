msp430_Projects_EEL4742
=======================

Present concepts and techniques in designing, realizing, debugging, and documenting embedded system applications.

The laboratory begins with a review of the Code Composer Studio (CCS) development system, which will be use extensively during the laboratory. Experiment #1 introduces the student to the fundamentals of CCS and its tool set such as the source, application and the debugger windows. In Experiment #2, the basic operations of the MSP430FG4618 Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter (UART) are discussed. Experiments #3 uses the UART develop basic input output routines such as ASCII to hexadecimal and ASCII to binary. Experiment #4 introduces the student to the LCD display used on the experimenter board while Experiment #5 uses the LCD display to display the output from hexadecimal addition, subtraction and multiplication. Experiment #6 discusses the use of interrupt on the MSP403FG4618 and how to write an interrupt service routine. Experiment #7 illustrates the use of the analog-to-digital converter as a method of reading external analog voltages applied to the MSP430FG4618.
Lab 6 makes a clock. Also I have code for other small msp430 projects here.
